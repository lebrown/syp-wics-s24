    "## Economic Mobility at Universities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, a team of researchers used anonymized data from the federal government to publish statistics for each college in the U.S.  on the distribution of students’ earnings in their thirties and their parents’ incomes.  We showed that students from low-income families have excellent long-term outcomes after attending selective schools, but that there are very few low-income students at these schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work was highlighted in several news sites: \n",
    "\n",
    "* [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html)  including interactive visualizations\n",

    "\n",
    "As many of you may be looking at colleges to attend in the near future.  We can see how Data Science can help answer questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will analyze the data looking at College Mobility. We will focus on public universities and community colleges in Michigan. An important justification for public spending on higher education is that colleges and universities may be seen as the 'engines of social mobility'. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will do three things. First, we will investigate how access, success, and upward mobility rates vary across institutions. Second, we will  explore how access has changed over time, as Michigan’s spending on public higher education has declined or stagnated. Third, we will write a function that generates a Report Card for a provided institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises are intended to illustrate how descriptive statistics alone can provide valuable insights and motivate new questions.\n",
